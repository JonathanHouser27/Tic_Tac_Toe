# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Player vs Computer)
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against the computer. The game will display a 3x3 board and you, as the player, will place 'X' while the computer places 'O'. The game continues until there is either a winner or a tie.

Features:
Two-player gameplay: Player (X) vs Computer (O)

A randomized computer move

Board drawing after each move

Win and tie detection

How to Play:
The game will display the Tic-Tac-Toe board with positions numbered 1 to 9.

The player will be prompted to choose a position (from 1-9) to place their marker ('X').

After the playerâ€™s move, the board will be redrawn, and then the computer will randomly place its marker ('O').

The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move.

If there is a winner, a message will indicate whether the player has won or lost.

If the game ends in a tie, a message will notify you of the tie.
